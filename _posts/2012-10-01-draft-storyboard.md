================

The user receives a notification from our application, to notify them that the time has come to enter their mood in our app.
When they click the notification, the "New mood" window of the application opens. This is the first image shown (__ref__).
The user enters their mood, using the diagram shown in the figure. They tap the screen at the emotion they feel at the moment.
The user can optionally also enter what they're doing at the moment. The list of possible options is already configured using the application's settings dialog.
The user's location is automatically obtained, but can be changed by the user (e.g. in case of a broken gps).

After entering their mood, the user is transported to the main window of the application, shown in figure 2 (__ref__).
The first button allows the user to go to the "New mood" window. The user is allowed to enter their mood whenever they want, the notifications are only a reminder.
There are also buttons to show the various graphs, containing the data the app has gathered.

Upon clicking the "moodspots" button, the user is shown the window in figure 3 (__ref__).
